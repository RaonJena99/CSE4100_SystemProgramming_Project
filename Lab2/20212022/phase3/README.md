Overview:
This shell program is an enhanced version with job control features, such as managing background and foreground processes, handling signals like SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGTSTP (Ctrl+Z), and providing built-in commands for job manipulation.

Main Functionality:
The program implements a shell interface where users can enter commands interactively.
It supports both built-in commands (like quit, exit, cd, jobs, bg, fg, kill) and external commands.
It manages background and foreground processes, allowing users to run processes in the background with & or bring background processes to the foreground.

Job Control:
The program maintains a list of jobs with their process IDs, statuses, and corresponding commands.
It handles signals like SIGCHLD (child process status change), SIGTSTP (Ctrl+Z), and SIGINT (Ctrl+C) to control job execution and update job statuses accordingly.

Built-in Commands:
The shell supports various built-in commands for job management:
quit or exit: Exit the shell.
cd: Change directory.
jobs: Display a list of active jobs.
bg <job>: Move a background job to the foreground.
fg <job>: Move a job to the background.
kill <job>: Terminate a job.

Parsing Command Line:
The parseline() function parses the command line and determines whether a job should run in the background or foreground.

Execution and Pipelining:
The eval() function evaluates the command line, handles built-in commands, and executes external commands or piped commands.
It sets up pipelines for commands separated by |, and forks child processes to execute them.

Signal Handling:
The signal_handler() function handles signals like SIGCHLD, SIGTSTP, and SIGINT to manage job status changes and process control.

Job Management Functions:
Functions like Add(), Delete(), Print_Job(), Finish(), Free_Job(), etc., manage the list of jobs, update their statuses, and handle job-related operations.
